# wc3270
## Description  
A hacked 3270 emulator for Windows that displays hidden fields and removes field protection

## Usage
1. download the archive
2. extract it and run wc3270.exe
3. Enjoy

## Credit 
The tool adapts the patch developped by [@singe](https://github.com/sensepost/birp) to apply it to wc3270 given how hard it is to have x3270 running on Windows (cygwin, x server, etc.)
