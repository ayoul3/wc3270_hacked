<h1>x3270 and SSL</h1>
x3270 support secures communication via the Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL).  (The text
below refers to <i>x3270</i>, but the descriptions actually apply to all of the
members of the suite.)
<p>x3270 SSL support uses the <a href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a>
library.
Much of the information below is common to many OpenSSL clients and more
extensive documentation is available on the Web.
<p>
A secure connection can be negotiated immediately by specifying the
<b>L:</b> prefix on the hostname (e.g., <b>L:foo.whatever.net</b>), or can
be negotiated later via the TELNET STARTTLS option (which is initiated by
the host after the connection has been established).</p>
<h3>A Note on PEM Format</h3>
<i>PEM</i> (Privacy Enhanced Mail) is a text file format used for SSL
certificates and private keys.
It is easily recognized by headers like the following:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----</tt>
<p>A certificate is the text between (and including) the BEGIN CERTIFICATE
and END CERTIFICATE headers. A private key is the text between (and including)
the BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY and END RSA PRIVATE KEY headers.
A PEM-format file can contain multiple certificates and keys.
<h2>Options and Resources</h2>
SSL is controlled by a number of different command-line options and resources.
<h3>Specifying the Server's Root Certificate</h3>
If your host's certificate was not signed by a well-known certificate authority
(CA), you can configure x3270 to accept it by specifying an alternate set of
root certificate(s).
</p>The <b>-cafile</b> option (or the <b>caFile</b> resource) can be used to
specify a file containing one or more server root certificates.
This file must be in PEM format.</p>
<p>If there are a large number of certificates, the <b>-cadir</b> option (or
the <b>caDir</b> resource) can be used to specify a directory containing root
certificates.
This directory contains files that use the naming convention of
<i>hash</i>.<i>seq</i>, where <i>hash</i> is the hash of the certificate
value and <i>seq</i> is a sequence number (since multiple certificates could
have the same hash) starting with 0.
<h3>Updating the Root Certificate Database</h3>
To avoid having to specify a root certificate for each invocation of x3270,
one or more certificates can be added to the OpenSSL root certificate database.
On Linux and Unix, this procedure is (unfortunately) an
operating-system- and release- specific procedure.
Howevever, the OpenSSL root certificate database is common to all OpenSSL
applications on your workstation, so instructions on updating it should be
easily found on the web.
<p>On Windows, the root certificate database used by wc3270, ws3270 and
wpr3287 is installed as part of the setup procedure and updating it is
documented below.
<p>The root certificate database is a PEM-format text file called
<b>root-certs.txt</b>.
The file is located in the wc3270 Application Data directory.
(The Application Data directory varies between Windows releases, but it is
easily found by selecting <b>wc3270 Explore AppData</b> in the <b>wc3270</b>
program group.) You can add your root certificate
(which must be in PEM format) to this file with a text editor such as
Notepad.
<h3>Specifying a Certificate for the Client (the Emulator)</h3>
If you have been issued a certificate and a private key to allow your client
(the emulator) to be authenticated by your host, there are several options that
allow this to be specified to x3270.
<p>The <b>-certfile</b> option (or the <b>certFile</b> resource) defines a
file containing the client certificate.
By default, this file is in PEM format, but it can also be in ASN1 format,
which is specified by setting the <b>-certfiletype</b> option (or the
<b>certFileType</b> resource) to the value <b>asn1</b>.</p>
<p>The <b>-chainfile</b> option (or the <b>chainFile</b> resource) defines a
PEM-format file containing both the client certificate and any intermediate
certificates that were used to sign it.
If a chain file is specified, it is used instead of the certificate file.</p>
<h3>Specifying the Private Key for the Client Certificate</h3>
The file containing the private key for the client certificate can be specified
by the <b>-keyfile</b> option or the <b>keyFile</b> resource.
This file is in PEM format by default, but can be in ASN1 format, by
specifying the <b>-keyfiletype</b> option or the <b>keyFileType</b> resource
with the value <b>asn1</b>.
<p>If no explicit key file is specified, the default is to find the private
key in the chain file or the client certificate file (whichever was
specified).</p>
<p>If the private key is encrypted, then a password must be specified.
The password is given with the <b>-keypasswd</b> option or the <b>keyPasswd</b>
resource.
The password can have one of two formats.
The format <b>file:</b><i>filename</i> specifies a file containing the password.
The format <b>string:</b><i>string</i> specifies the password as a string in
the option or resource directly.</p>
<h2>Windows and the OpenSSL DLLs</h2>
There are two versions of each of the Windows
emulators, one with SSL support and one without.
An option in the setup program defines which set is installed.
<p>The secure versions of wc3270, s3270 and wpr3287 will not function
without OpenSSL DLLs installed on your workstation.
These DLLs are not part of the wc3270 installation -- installing them is a
completely separate process.
<p>The Windows OpenSSL DLLs for wc3270 are available here:</p>
