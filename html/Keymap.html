<h1>How to Create a Custom wc3270 Keymap</h1>

<h2>It Might Already be Defined</h2>
First, you might want to make sure that the action you want isn't already
defined in the default keymap. The default keymap, documented on the
<a href="wc3270-man.html#default-keymap"><b>wc3270</b>
manual page</a>, defines many common actions.
For example, the <b>Reset</b> action, which unlocks the keyboard, is defined
as <b>Alt</b>-r.
<h2>Defining a Keymap in a File</h2>
If the mappings you want aren't defined in the default keymap,
you can create a custom keymap.
The easiest way to do this is to follow this example -- a custom keymap that
maps <b>Page Up</b> to <b>PF7</b> and <b>Page Down</b> to <b>PF8</b>.
<p>
First, pick a unique name for your keymap, e.g., <i>mine</i>.
Using a text editor such as <b>notepad</b>, create a file called
<tt>mine.wc3270km</tt> in the <b>wc3270</b> installation directory.
(The <b>wc3270</b> installation directory is usually <tt>C:\Program Files\wc3270</tt>, but can vary depending on your Windows installation and the options
you chose when you installed <b>wc3270</b>.)
In that file, put the following:
<blockquote>
<pre>
!description: Map PageUp and PageDown to PF7/PF8
&lt;Key>PRIOR: PF(7)
&lt;Key>NEXT: PF(8)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that in a keymap file, comment lines start with <b>!</b>.
Comment lines are ignored, except for one special one (shown above): a
comment line starting with <tt>!description:</tt> will be displayed by the
<i>New Session Wizard</i> as the description of the keymap.
<p>To use the keymap, you can either create a new <b>wc3270</b>
session, or you can modify an existing one.
<p>
To create a new one, run the <i>wc3270 New Session Wizard</i>.
The list of available keymaps should now include <b>mine</b>.
<p>To modify an existing session, use <b>notepad</b> to edit the session
file.
(Session files are located in the <b>wc3270</b> installation directory, and
have the suffix <b>.wc3270</b>, so the session file for <b>foo</b> is called
<tt>foo.wc3270</tt>.)
If the session already uses a keymap, it will have a line that starts with
<tt>wc3270.keymap:</tt>.
If it has this line, modify it to specify <b>mine</b> instead.
If it does not have this line, add it:
<blockquote>
    <pre>
    wc3270.keymap: mine
    </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, run your <b>wc3270</b> session.
The <b>Page Up</b> key should now emulate the 3270 <b>PF7</b> key, and the
<b>Page Down</b> key should now emulate the 3270 <b>PF8</b> key.
</p>
<h2>Rules for Keymap Definition Files</h2>
You may now edit the keymap to create your own custom definition.
Here is the full set of rules.
Each line has the format:
<ul>
<pre>[<i>modifier...</i>] &lt;Key> <i>keyname</i>... : <i>action</i>[(<i>args</i>)]...</pre>
</ul>
where:
	<ul>
		<i>modifier</i> is a keyboard modifier such as
		<tt>Ctrl</tt> or <tt>Alt</tt><br>
		<i>keyname</i> is a key name: a symbolic name for a key,
		such as <tt>semicolon</tt> (the ';' key) or a Windows
		key name such as <tt>HOME</tt> (the <b>Home</b> key)<br>
		<i>action</i> is a <b>wc3270</b> action such as <tt>Enter</tt>
		or <tt>PF</tt><br>
		<i>args</i> are the optional action arguments, such as a number
		to specify which PF key to transmit.
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>Note that order matters in the keymap.
Three important rules apply:
<ul>
 <li>User-specified keymaps appear <i>after</i> the default keymap.</li>
 <li>More-specific entries must come before less-specific ones.</li>
 <li>If there is more than one entry mapping exactly the same key (with the
  modifiers), the last one wins.</li>
</ul>
An example of the second rule is if you want to map both <b>BACK</b> (the
<b>Backspace</b> key) and <b>Shift-BACK</b>.
The entry for <b>Shift-BACK</b> must come before the entry for <b>BACK</b>,
otherwise the entry for <b>Shift-BACK</b> will be ignored.
<p>The first rule, combined with the second, means that a default key mapping
may interfere with your keymap.
For example, if you want to define a mapping for <b>Ctrl-Shift-F1</b>, the
default mapping for <b>Shift-F1</b> (<b>PF13</b>) will override it.
The way around this is to use the third rule: define your own mapping for
<b>Shift-F1</b>.  Your entry will disable the one in the default keymap.
But (because of the second rule) be sure to put it <i>after</i>
your entry for <b>Ctrl-Shift-F1</b>.
<p>Also note that except for entries that use the <b>Ctrl</b> modifier,
mappings are case-sensitive.
For example, an entry for <b>Alt-p</b> will not be matched if the Shift key
is down or Caps Lock is in effect.  To match both <b>Alt-p</b>
and <b>Alt-P</b>, there must be two entries in your keymap.

<h2>How to Find the Modifiers</h2>
The list of modifiers is on the
<a href="wc3270-man.html#Keymaps">wc3270 manual page</a>.
<h2>How to Find the Key Names</h2>
The names for alphanumeric keys can be entered literally, e.g., <tt>a</tt>
for the <tt>A</tt> key.
They can also be entered using ISO 8859-1 standard names, such as
<tt>colon</tt> for the <tt>:</tt> key (which would otherwise confuse the
keymap syntax).
Finally, Unicode values (<tt>U+</tt><i>nnnn</i>) can be used.
<p>
The list of names for special Windows keys, such as PRIOR, NEXT and HOME,
is on the <a href="wc3270-man.html#Keymaps">wc3270 manual page</a>.
<p>
To find out which key or sequence of keys is being generated for any
given key on your keyboard, start <b>wc3270</b> with the <b>-set eventTrace</b>
option.
<b>wc3270</b> will create a pop-up window showing a trace file, which will
include several lines of text for each key that is pressed.
Each entry will include the text for the left-hand side of a keymap entry
that will match that key.
You can copy and paste the text into a keymap definition.
The trace file is <tt>x3trc.<i>pid</i></tt> in the current directory.

<h2>How to Find the Actions</h2>
These are documented on the <a href="wc3270-man.html#actions"><b>wc3270</b>
manual page</a>.

<h2>How to Debug Your Keymap</h2>
There are two <b>wc3270</b> options to aid with keymap debugging.
The first is the <b>-set eventTrace</b> option described above.
The information traced includes the keymap (and line within the keymap)
that matched the event, the <b>wc3270</b> action that was run in response,
and if for some reason the action did not work, why it did not work.
<p>The second is the <b>show keymap</b> command at the <b>wc3270></b> prompt,
which displays the current keymap.
This tells you exactly which keymap entries are active.
Often times it will point out that <b>wc3270</b> isn't using the keymap you
thought it was, or that some of your keymap entries
are interfering with one another.

<h2>More Information</h2>
This document is not an exhaustive definition of keymaps -- the complete
reference is the <a href="wc3270-man.html#Keymaps">wc3270 manual page</a>.
It describes the many possible, subtle variations of the rules described above.
