 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Added a key sequence for screen printing (<b>Ctrl-a</b>,
 <b>p</b>).</li>
</ul>

  changed between print jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.11beta5, 30. July 2010</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[all 3270] Improved tracing.  Trace entries now include time stamps.

  clear the 3270 buffer between pages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.11beta2, 6. May 2010</h2>
<ul>

  to display the time taken for the host to process an AID in the OIA.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Overhauled auto-shortcut mode, so that no shortcut is
  needed to run a wc3270 session file.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.10ga5, 6. May 2010</h2>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Corrected a screen refresh problem when first

  which were "sticky", i.e., once set they would be set for all future
  connections.</li>
 <li>[all] Corrected the reported CGCSGID for code page 1147
  (french-euro).</li>
 <li>[all except <i>x3270</i>] Disabled the Query Reply report for background
  color support, which confused some older versions of GDDM.  This report can
  be explicitly enabled by setting the <b>qrBgColor</b> resource to
  <b>true</b>.</li>
 <li>[all] In oversize mode, changed the terminal type to <b>IBM-DYNAMIC</b>.
  </li>
</ul>

  if the terminal supports it.  Add a <b>Mouse</b> resource, which can be
  set to <b>False</b> to disable it.</li>
 <li>[all 3270] Added a <b>Translate</b> keyword to the <b>Transfer</b>
  action's parameters and an additional question to the interactive
  <b>c3270</b>/<b>wc3270</b> <b>Transfer</b> dialog, to allow the automatic
  remapping of text (usually done to get the most accurate translation)
  to be disabled.</li>
 <li>Restored the pop-up window that displays trace files.</li>

  </li>
 <li>[all 3270] Fixed a crash with the <b>Toggle</b> action and undefined
  toggles.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Implemented no-install mode (allowing <i>wc3270</i> to run
 without installing the software) and auto-shortcut mode (where <i>wc3270</i>
 automatically creates a temporary shortcut file to match a session file and
 runs it).</li>
 <li>[all 3270] When a hostname resolves to multiple addresses, try each until
  one works.</li>
 <li>[all 3270] Corrected an issue where the keyboard would lock on the first
  screen when connecting to hosts like Hercules.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added mappings of the <b>Page Up</b> and <b>Page Down</b>
  keys to <b>PF(7)</b> and <b>PF(8)</b> respectively.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>, <i>ws3270</i>] Removed the <b>.dll</b> files from the

 <li>[all but <i>wc3270</i>] Don't crash when there is no <i>iconv</i>
  translation for the locale codeset.</li>
 <li>[all but <i>x3270</i>] Fixed a build failure in glue.c when DBCS was
   disabled.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Corrected the default keymap so that the uppercase

  that command-line parameters override session files.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Made session files replace profiles, rather than just
  overridding any common definitions.  This is more intuitive and consistent
  with x3270.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.9ga11, 27. February 2009</h2>
<h3>Common Changes</h3>

  host name, or port).</li>
 <li>Fixed a number of compiler warnings from newer versions of gcc and a
  number of small memory leaks.</li>
 <li>Overhauled the host code pages and CGCSGIDs for DBCS.  Added
  <b>sbcsCgcsgid</b> and <b>dbcsCgcsgid</b> resources to override the
  compiled-in values.</li>
 <li>Added a <b>caption <i>text</i></b> option to the <b>PrintText</b>
  action, which will place the specified caption above the screen image.
  Within the text, the string <tt>%T%</tt> is interpolated to a timestamp.</li>
 <li>Improved the state dump when tracing starts to include NVT and
  SSCP-LU state and the SNA BIND image.</li>
 <li>Updated the copyright and licensing notices (now a standard BSD
  license).</li>
 <li>Added support for carriage-return (0x0d) characters in the
  <b>String</b> action, which imply the <b>Newline</b> action.</li>

  BREAK in TN3270 mode, and locks the keyboard in TN3270E mode when the
  session is not SNA bound.</i>
 <li>Added Traditional Chinese (host code page 937) support.</li>
 <li>Extended the <b>String</b> action's <b>\e</b> and <b>\x</b> sequences

</ul>
<h2>Changes in version 3.3.8, 11 October 2008</h2>
Version 3.3.8 includes a significant internal change, using Unicode for all
translations between the host and the local workstation.
This change should be
transparent, but users who depended on certain behaviors of the old
implementation may see unexpected differences.
<h3>Common Changes</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Many more EBCDIC characters, such as Graphics Escape line-drawing and APL
  characters, are now properly displayed (even without special 3270 fonts),
  traced, cut/pasted with other applications, and returned by scripting actions
  like <b>Ascii</b>.
 <li>With two exceptions, the locale's encoding is now observed consistently
  when reading keymaps, generating trace files, etc.
  The exceptions are:
  <ul>
   <li><b>tcl3270</b> always uses UTF-8, per the internal Tcl convention.</li>
   <li>Because Cygwin doesn't really support locales, the Windows ANSI code
    page is used as the local encoding instead.</li>
   <li>Stateful encodings such as ISO 2022 are untested and very likely do
    not work.</li>
  </ul>
 <li>The ICU library is no longer used, and ICU <b>.cnv</b> files are no longer
  included with the code.</li>
 <li>Translation to/from the local encoding requires one of two facilities:
  Either <b>libc</b> must support <tt>__STDC_ISO_10646__</tt> (<b>wchar_t</b>s
  are defined to be unicode values, as on Linux and Windows), or there must be
  an <b>iconv</b> library that can translate between UTF-8 and all local
  encodings.</li>
 <li>DBCS support is enabled by default, except on Windows.
  It can be explicitly
  disabled in the <b>configure</b> script to reduce the size of the
  executable (removing several large translation tables).</li>
 <li>The <b>-v</b>/<b>--verbose</b> option has been added to display build and
  copyright information.</li>
 <li>The Thai host code page has changed from 838 to 1160.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes Common to the 3270 Terminal Emulators</h3>
<ul>
 <li>The <b>Key</b> action now accepts Unicode arguments in the form
  <b>U+<i>nnnn</i></b>, removing possible ambiguity from translating from the
 <li>Added a <b>Source</b> action to read script commands from a file.</li>
 <li> Added a 10 second timeout to the start of the <b>Transfer</b> action.</li>
 <li>Added an <b>unlockDelayMs</b> resource to change the number of
  milliseconds of delay before atually unlocking the keyboard after the
  host requests it. The default is 350; use 0 to disable the delay
  altogether.</li>
 <li>IND$FILE file transfer now transfers DBCS text files properly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes Common to 3287 Printer Emulators</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Added direct support for all <b>x3270</b> host character sets via the
  <b>-charset</b> option.
 <li>Added <b>-trnpre</b> and <b>-trnpost</b> options to specify files
  containing transparent data to send to the printer before and after
  each print job, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Product-Speific Changes</h3>
<ul>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Commands entered into the <b>Print Screen Text</b> dialog
  are now saved by the <b>Save Changed Options in File</b> option.
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] Fixed some bad interactions between the pop-up keypad and
  the GNOME window manager.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] The Euro fonts have been folded into the standard
  fonts.</li>
 <li>[<i>x3270</i>] The font menu is now arranged hierarchically by
  foundry and family.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Added an <b>underscore</b> toggle to allow underlined
  fields to be displayed even on consoles with no native underlining
  support, by substituting underscore '_' characters for blanks and nulls
  in underlined fields.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Overhauled <b>Meta</b> and <b>Alt</b> key support.
  Removed support for the archaic <b>Meta</b> modifier in keymaps (it was an
  alias for setting bit 0x80 in each key).  Replaced it with an <b>Alt</b>
  modifier, which matches the <b>ESC</b> sequence sent for the <b>Alt</b> key
  by many terminals, and which can be combined with full 8-bit input
  characters.<li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Changed the interpretation of keymaps so that keys and
  symbols are matched in Unicode.  That is, keymap text is converted from the
  current locale's encoding to Unicode before matching, and input character
  codes are converted to Unicode before matching.  This eliminates the
  difficulty in creating keymaps and interpreting traces in non-Latin-1
  locales -- needing to translate from the accidental interpretation of
  8-bit values as Latin-1 when they are not -- but with the side-effect
  of rendering some carefully-crafted existing keymaps invalid.  Keymaps
  can also be written using Unicode <b>U+<i>nnnn</i></b> notation.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Changed the <b>metaEscape</b> resource so that <b>auto</b>
  means <b>on</b>, instead of using the terminfo <b>km</b> resource.</li>
 <li>[<i>c3270</i>] Added an <b>acs</b> resource to control the use of curses
  ACS codes.
  If <b>c3270.acs</b> is set to <b>true</b> (the default), <b>c3270</b>
  will use curses ACS codes for line-drawing characters.  If set to
  <b>false</b>, it will display line-drawing characters with Unicode.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Added an <b>underscore</b> toggle to control how
  underlined and blinking fields are displayed.  If it is set (the default),
  underlined fields are displayed by substituting underscore (_)
  characters for blanks and nulls, and blinking fields actually blink.
  If it is clear, underlined and blinking fields are displayed with
  highlighted backgrounds, which is compatible with previous verions of
  <b>wc3270</b>.</li>
 <li>[<i>wc3270</i>] Left-clicking with the mouse will now move the cursor

<h2>Changes in wc3270 3.3.7, 25. December 2007</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed line-drawing characters.</li>
      <li>Enabled IPv6 support for Windows XP and later.</li>
      <li>Set the input code page correctly, so that keyboard input works
       correctly when there is a mismatch between the default Windows code
       page and the code page implied by the wc3270 character set option.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
      <li>Added limited support for Windows 98.  wc3270 will install and run on
       Windows 98, but internationalization support is limited -- the only
       supported host code page is 37, and the only supported Windows code
       page is 437.  This is expected to improve in the future.</li>
      <li>Added a <b>wc3270.highlightUnderline</b> resource to control
       highlighting of underlined and blinking text.  (Set to <b>false</b> to
       disable background highlighting.)</li>
      <li>Moved session files, keymaps and trace files to the Application
       Data directory. (<b>wc3270</b> will still look in its installation
       directory for session files and keymaps, after first searching the
       Application Data directory.)
       This makes <b>wc3270</b> a better Windows citizen in general, and a
       better Vista citizen in particular.</li>
      <li>Added support for changing the color mappings.  The console color
       for a given host color can be specified with the resource
       <b>wc3270.consoleColorForHostColor<i>n</i></b>, where <i>n</i> is a
       host color number (0 through 15), and the value of the resource is a
       console color number (0 through 15).
       <br>In addition, the
       field-attribute-based colors used when the host does not specify a
       particular color can be changed via the following resources:
       <pre>
wc3270.hostColorForDefault
wc3270.hostColorForIntensified
wc3270.hostColorForProtected
wc3270.hostColorForProtectedIntensified
       </pre>
       The value for each of these is a host color number; the actual color
       displayed is defined by the corresponding
       <b>wc3270.consoleColorForHostColor<i>n</i></b>
       resource.</li>
      <li>Added a new <b>cp1153</b> character set.
       It implements host code page 1153 and uses Windows code page 1250,
       used primarily in Central Europe.</li>
      <li>Added display of the Windows code page to the character set
       screen in the New Session Wizard.</li>
      <li>Added display of the host and Windows code pages to the <b>show

<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed the <b>highlighted</b> attribute for individual regions of the
      screen (versus the <b>highlighted</b> field attribute); it had been
      accidentally disabled.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>New Features:

      <li>Added support for IBM Code Page 1047 (<b>-charset cp1047</b>).</li>
      <li>Added proxy support via the <b>-proxy</b> option or the <b>proxy</b>
      resource.</li>
      <li>Modified <i>Blank Fill</i> mode to treat trailing underscore
      chararacters ('<b>_</b>') like blanks when checking for input
      overflow.</li>
      <li><i>Pseudo-Color</i> mode is no more.
      This was the mode that x3270 used when a 3278 model was specified, or
      if the <b>m3279</b> resource were set to <b>False</b>.
      Pseudo-Color assigned colors to regions of the screen based on
      intensity and light-pen selectability, and did not support 3279 colors.
      Now turning off color or selecting a 3278 results in something that
      looks like a 3278 (i.e., it's green).
      To resurrect Pseudo-Color mode, set the following resources:
      <preformat>
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;x3270.inputColor: orange<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;x3270.boldColor: cyan

       macro or string.  This allows macros and strings with embedded AID
       sequences to work with hosts that unlock the keyboard before they
       finish processing a command.  Scripts are presumed to be able to
       figure out when the host is finished, or can set the <b>unlockDelay</b>
       resource to <b>true</b> get the delay all the time.</li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in x3270, c3270, s3270 and tcl3270 3.3.3beta2, 1. February 2005</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced the Resident Set Size (RSS) of x3270 from about 40 MBytes to
       less than 4 MBytes.  This was a bug in how compiled-in app-defaults
       files were generated.</li>
      <li>Got separate app-defaults files (<b>configure --enable-app-defaults</b>)
       to work again.</li>
      <li>Fixed a crash when a login macro is used in NVT mode or when the
       host un-negotiates TN3270E mode.</li>
      <li>Fixed the titles of the Copyright and Configuration pop-ups.</li>
      <li>Temporarily disabled the RPQNAMES Query Reply.  It was causing IBM
       QMF to crash.  It can be re-enabled by adding <b>#define X3270_RPQNAMES
       1</b> to <b>conf.h</b>.  Hopefully a proper fix can be found shortly.
       </li>
    </ul>

</ul>

<h2>Changes in x3270, c3270, s3270 and tcl3270 3.3.3beta1, 31. December 2004</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>The <b>Transfer()</b> action did not work at all -- it generated
       (null) as the name of the <b>IND$FILE</b> command.
       Also improved its behavior when invoked from a script or macro in
       x3270 and c3270.</li>
      <li>Corrected the definition of the <b>hebrew</b> (code page 424)
       character set, removing undefined characters.</li>
      <li>Corrected the display character set for the <b>brazilian</b> (code
       page 275) character set.</li>
      <li>Corrected the character set definition logic so that undefined
       ASCII codes are truly undefined in NVT mode.</li>
      <li>Corrected the <b>ibm_hosts</b> file (the <b>hostsFile</b> resource
       or the <b>-hostsfile</b> option).
       Variable and tilde substitution are now performed on the value, and if
       a non-default value is specified and the file does not exist, an error
       pop-up is generated.</li>
      <li>Added a pause to make sure that c3270 start-up error messages will
       be seen.</li>
      <li>Got the c3270 default field colors right, and made all-bold mode
       actually make all the fields bold.</li>
      <li>Fixed the default primary/alternate screen size (it was alternate,
       it's supposed to be primary).</li>
      <li>Fixed c3270 color support with ncurses and 80/132 screen-size
       switching.
       Sometimes only one of the screen sizes had color.</li>
      <li>Fixed a memory leak in pr3287 when the <b>-reconnect</b> option
       is used. (<i>Thanks to Marcelo Lemos for the fix.</i>)</li>
      <li>Fixed the output of NVT-mode ANSI line-drawing characters in the
       <b>Ascii()</b> scripting action.
       These were formerly all output as blanks; now they are output in
       the same was as x3270 3.2.</li>
      <li>Fixed the display of NVT-mode ANSI line-drawing characters when
       x3270 is using a 3270 font.</li>
      <li>Fixed the display of DBCS blanks, which sometimes displayed as
       'undefined' characters.</li>
      <li>Fixed DBCS character display with fonts whose maximum bounds are
       larger than their reported line-spacing bounds.</li>
      <li>Fixed <b>make depend</b>.</li>
      <li>Fixed <b>x3270_glue.expect</b>, which got confused when there was
       a whitespace-delimited double-quote in the emulator output.</li>
      <li>Fixed crashes when the entire File or Options menus were suppressed.
       </li>
      <li>Fixed a scripting hang when an UNBIND command arrived while an AID
       was pending.</li>
      <li>Fixed a problem with the incomplete processing of a NULLing Program
       Tab order, which could leave formatting artifacts on the screen.</li>
      <li>Removed &lt;subchar1&gt; clauses in two of the <b>.ucm</b> files
       that prevents later versions of ICU's <b>makeconv</b> from accepting
       them, and removed DOS carriage-return characters from the CP837
       <b>.ucm</b> file.</li>
      <li>Corrected some DFT-mode file upload problems: corrected the data
       length, and corrected an empty-buffer problem when the file size was
       an even multiple of the buffer size.</li>
      <li>Corrected a DBCS conversion problem with ICU 3.0.</li>
      <li>Added variable buffer-size support to DFT file transfers.</li>
      <li>Corrected a line-drawing character bug in c3270.</li>
      <li>Fixed a buffer overflow problem in the <b>ReadBuffer</b> action.</li>
      <li>Fixed garbage characters generated for APL data by the <b>Ascii</b>
       and <b>ReadBuffer</b> actions.</li>
      <li>Allow 0 timeouts in <b>Wait</b> actions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
      <li>Added command-line options to the pr3287 trace file.</li>
      <li>Added support for <i>dead</i> keys (acute, grave, circumflex, tilde,
       diaeresis) to the x3270 default keymap, and improved the Latin-1 compose
       map. (<i>Thanks to Marcelo Lemos for the change.</i>)</li>
      <li>Added new actions for improved mouse interactions, and made them the
       default.  Button 1 now moves the cursor, without the Shift key.</li>
      <li>Added support for DBCS in pr3287, but only when started from an
       x3270 or c3270 session.</li>
      <li>Added Don Russell's RPQNAMES support.</li>
      <li>Removed Minolta-copyrighted 5250 code, because of licensing
       problems.</li>
      <li>Added an <b>aidWait</b> toggle to allow AID script actions
       (<b>Clear</b>, <b>Enter</b>, <b>PA</b> and <b>PF</b>) to complete
       immediately without waiting for the host to unlock the keyboard, and a
       <b>Wait(Unlock)</b> action action to block a script until the keyboard
       is unlocked, regardless of the state of the new toggle.</li>
      <li>Removed the old scripting hack that delayed actually unlocking the
       keyboard for 50ms after the host indicates that it should be unlocked.
       Added an <b>unlockDelay</b> resource, which can be set to <b>true</b> to
       turn the delay hack back on.</li>
      <li>Added a <b>dftBufferSize</b> resource to set the default DFT
       buffer size.</li>
      <li>Added an x3270  <b>Save Screen Text</b> menu option to save the
       screen image in a file, optionally in HTML.</li>
      <li>Added options to the PrintText action to save to a file, to save HTML,
       and to return the text as script data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in x3270, c3270, s3270 and tcl3270 3.3.2, 1. December 2003</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Bug Fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Corrected an x3270 screen-redraw crash when using <b>fixedSize</b>
       and <b>xim</b>.</li>
      <li>Corrected a problem in <b>x3270_glue.expect</b>, which caused
       Tcl syntax errors if a string began with a dash. <i>Thanks to David
       Taylor for the fix.</i></li>  
      <li>Fixed a problem with x3270 DBCS input when using a single DBCS/SBCS
       character set.</li>
      <li>Made DBCS encoding recognition automatic wherever possible, leaving
       the <b>-km</b> option for cases when x3270 can't figure it out from the
       locale.</li>
      <li>Made c3270's <b>configure</b> more robust when it can't find one or
       the other of <b>libncurses</b> or <b>ncurses.h</b>.</li>
      <li>Got automatic pr3287 start-up (<b>-printerlu</b>) working again in
       c3270.</li>
      <li>Fixed an s3270 crash which made s3270 3.3.1alpha10 pretty much
       useless.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
     <li>Added support for Cyrillic keysyms to the x3270 <b>Default()</b>
      action.</li>
     <li>Added an 'unlocked' icon for unencrypted connections, if x3270 is
      built with SSL/TLS support.</li>
     <li>Error messages are now written to the trace file.</li>
     <li>The response to the TELNET TIMING MARK option has been changed to
      make it compatible with the majority of TELNET clients.
      The response to DO TIMING MARK is now WONT TIMING MARK.
      To restore the previous behavior (responding with WILL TIMING MARK,
      originally derived from the BSD TELNET client), set the resource
      <b>x3270.bsdTm</b> to <b>true</b>.
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in x3270, c3270, s3270 and tcl3270 3.3.1alpha10, 29. August 2003</h2>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>

      the 3270 buffer, including field attributes and extended attributes.</li>
     <li>Added support for <b>suppress</b> resources for each menu item.
      If set to <b>True</b>, that menu item will not appear.</li>
     <li>Added a <b>suppressActions</b> resource, a list of the names of
      actions to disable.  This is primarily for controlled environments where
      the user does not have access to the <b>x3270</b> command line, but can
      edit keymap definitions.</li>
     <li>Added a <b>Setverbose</b> function to <tt>x3270_glue.expect</tt>

      be.</li>
     <li>Added a new x3270 keypad position (<b>x3270.keypad</b>):
      <b>insideRight</b>.  This positions the keypad on top of the upper
      right-hand corner of the <b>x3270</b> window, just under the keypad
      button on the menu bar.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in  pr3287 3.3.1alpha10, 10. August 2003</h2>

  <ul>
   <li>Added support for the <b>-tracedir</b> option, to specify a directory

      <li>Removed the concept of 'per-host' resources.  Use profiles for
       this.</li>
      <li>Fixed idle commands.  They were pretty much hopeless in 3.3.1alpha8
       and 3.2.20.</li>
      <li>Fixed a Unicode conversion crash.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug in processing the Modify Field order, which would cause
       the character set attribute for the field to be accidentally reset to
       the default.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Features:
    <ul>
      <li>x3270 user-specified lists (character sets, hosts, fonts,
       color schemes) can now be organized into sub-lists.
       The name <b>Bob>Fred>Tony</b> specifies that there is a sub-list called
       <b>Bob</b>, which contains a sub-list <b>Fred</b>, which contains the
       item <b>Tony</b>.</li>
      <li>The TELNET START-TLS option is now supported.</li>
